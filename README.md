a) Login Name Builder

A startup company has hired you to develop an application to generate login names
for their employees. The application prompts the user to enter a full name in the
format "surname forename". Next, the application uses the given full name to
create the corresponding login name. The login name is created using the following
rules:
• The login name starts with the surname, all the letters in the surname are
used in the login name
• Only the vowels from the given forename will be used in the login name (i.e.
the consonants from the given forename are not used in the login name)
• The login name contains no space
• The login name will end with the total number of characters in the initial full
name (including spaces)


b) Travel Deals

Your local travel agency provides discounts to students. They hired you to develop
an application to determine the price for a student trip. The application prompts the
user to specify when they want to take the trip (that is either during winter break or
summer break), and the number of students who will travel together. Next, the
application should compute the price per student and the total price per trip (i.e.
based on the number of students traveling together).
